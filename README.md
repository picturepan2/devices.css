## Getting started

Download the compiled and minified [Devices.css files](https://github.com/picturepan2/devices.css). Include `devices.css` located in `/dist` in your website or Web app &lt;head&gt; part.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/devices.css">`

Go to [Demo page](https://devicescss.xyz/) to copy the device HTML source code and paste it to anywhere you want. All devices use the same HTML structure with different `device-[device-name]` classes.

```
<div class="device device-iphone-x">
  <div class="device-frame">
    <img class="device-screen" src="...">
  </div>
  <div class="device-stripe"></div>
  <div class="device-header"></div>
  <div class="device-sensors"></div>
  <div class="device-btns"></div>
  <div class="device-power"></div>
</div>
```
Also, there are optional `device-[device-color]` classes for different color variants.

You can add any screenshot or video with the `device-screen` class. The resolution aspect ratios are based on real ones.

## Custom

You can custom Devices.css by modifing SASS `.scss` files located in `src` folder.

- Chrome (LAST 4)
- Microsoft Edge (LAST 4)
- Firefox (EXTENDED SUPPORT RELEASE)
- Safari (LAST 4)
- Opera (LAST 4)
